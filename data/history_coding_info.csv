Quantum Computing,First theoretical foundations laid by Richard Feynman and David Deutsch in the 1980s.,"Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane are frameworks used to write quantum algorithms.",Quantum computing leverages principles of quantum mechanics like superposition and entanglement to perform computations much faster than classical computers for certain problems.
Artificial Intelligence,The term AI was coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference by John McCarthy.,"Python libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn are widely used for AI development.","AI involves creating systems that can learn, reason, and adapt. It powers applications like chatbots, recommendation engines, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection."
Magadh Empire,"The Magadh Empire, founded in the 6th century BCE, played a crucial role in Indian history. Chandragupta Maurya expanded it under the Maurya Dynasty.","Not directly related to coding, but digital archives and history websites often store information about the Magadh Empire using database technologies.","Magadh was one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas and became the foundation for the Maurya and Gupta empires. It contributed significantly to politics, culture, and trade in ancient India."
Python Programming,"Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, inspired by the ABC language.","Python supports object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming. Widely used in web development, AI, data science, and automation.","Python is popular due to its simplicity, readability, and vast ecosystem of libraries. It is beginner-friendly yet powerful for advanced applications."
